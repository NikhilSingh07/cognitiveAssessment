## Project Summary

This project addresses linguistic and cultural challenges in cognitive assessment through a web-based application. Developed with Node.js, Express.js, React.js, and a PostgreSQL database, the application uses interactive searching and foraging tasks to assess cognitive abilities. The use of a game-like format not only makes the assessment enjoyable but also offers a distinctive way to evaluate cognitive skills.


## Project Overview

### Features

🎮 Game-Like Format: Users explore 18 items (6 shapes, 3 sizes) within a captivating and interactive environment.

🎯 Objective: The primary goal is to search for 6 hidden fruits beneath 6 items in each trial, introducing an element of challenge and concentration.

🧠 Cognitive Challenge: Clicking an item shuffles positions, evaluating foraging efficiency and working memory as users adapt to the changing environment.

🔍 Hidden Challenge: Uncover hidden patterns to test executive functions. Each pattern is linked to 2 shapes:


### Hidden Patterns

1. Pattern 1: Shapes never produce fruits.  
2. Pattern 2: Subsequent shapes yield fruit in every consecutive trial.  
3. Pattern 3: Subsequent shapes yield fruit in every alternate trial.  

## Why it Matters?

This app isn't just about playing games. It's a smart way to understand how our brains work, especially when it comes to memory and problem-solving. Plus, it's designed to be fair and consider different languages and cultures.
